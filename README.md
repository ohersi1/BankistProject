Things I learned and practiced in this project:

- Used the Intersection Observer API and learned how to use it to make the navbar sticky after it reaches a certain point down the page.

- Learned how to use smooth scrolling to give the users a better experience on the website.

- Learned about lazy loading images to reduce load time of websites to benefit users.

- Learned how to reveal sections/elements only when you scroll down to them with a cool animation.

- Learned how to create a testimonial slider which was new to me and quite complex but really enjoyed creating it.
